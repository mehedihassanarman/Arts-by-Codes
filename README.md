# Drawing by C++ (Advanced Level)
Bird Drawing by C++.

You need to download and link "graphics.h" header file to your environment. I used Code Blocks for this program.

Try to use 32 bit version of Code Blocks for this program. Some users have experienced problems to link "graphics.h" header file for 64 bit version.
